## Example vxWorks startup file

## The following is needed if your board support package doesn't at boot time
## automatically cd to the directory containing its startup script
#cd "_TOP_/iocBoot/_IOC_"

< cdCommands
#< ../nfsCommands

cd topbin
## You may have to change _APPNAME_ to something else
## everywhere it appears in this file

ld < _APPNAME_.munch

## This drvTS initializer is needed if the IOC has a hardware event system
#TSinit

## Register all support components
cd top
dbLoadDatabase("dbd/_APPNAME_.dbd",0,0)
_CSAFEAPPNAME__registerRecordDeviceDriver(pdbbase)

## Load record instances
dbLoadTemplate "db/user.substitutions"
dbLoadRecords("db/dbSubExample.db","user=_USER_")

## Set this to see messages from mySub
#mySubDebug = 1

cd startup
iocInit()

## Start any sequence programs
#seq &sncExample,"user=_USER_"
