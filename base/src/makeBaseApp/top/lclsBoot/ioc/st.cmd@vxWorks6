## Example vxWorks startup file

## The following is needed if your board support package doesn't at boot time
## automatically cd to the directory containing its startup script
#cd "_TOP_/iocBoot/_IOC_"

< cdCommands
#< ../nfsCommands


# IOCs can load settings which are common
# for all IOCs. Such as EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST, etc...
# The file: pre_st.cmd does the trick
# </afs/slac/g/lcls/build/epics/iocCommon/All/pre_st.cmd


cd topbin
## You may have to change _APPNAME_ to something else
## everywhere it appears in this file

ld < _APPNAME_.munch

## This drvTS initializer is needed if the IOC has a hardware event system
#TSinit

## Register all support components
cd top
dbLoadDatabase("dbd/_APPNAME_.dbd",0,0)
_APPNAME__registerRecordDeviceDriver(pdbbase)

## Load record instances
dbLoadRecords("db/dbExample1.db","user=_USER_")
dbLoadRecords("db/dbExample2.db","user=_USER_,no=1,scan=1 second")
dbLoadRecords("db/dbExample2.db","user=_USER_,no=2,scan=2 second")
dbLoadRecords("db/dbExample2.db","user=_USER_,no=3,scan=5 second")
dbLoadRecords("db/dbSubExample.db","user=_USER_")

## Set this to see messages from mySub
#mySubDebug = 1

cd startup
iocInit()

## Start any sequence programs
#seq &sncExample,"user=_USER_"

## Now we need to do a favor for the IRMIS crawler
## All IOCs should dump some common info after initial
## startup.
