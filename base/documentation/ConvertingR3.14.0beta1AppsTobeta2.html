<h2> Converting an EPICS R3.14.0 beta1 application to beta2</h2></center>

<p><br>This document describes how to convert a R3.14.0beta1 application
so that it builds with release R3.14.0beta2.

<h3>Update Unix  LD_LIBRARY_PATH</h3>

If you build EPICS base shared libraries instead of archive
libraries on Unix systems you will need to update your
LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to include fullpathname
to the NEW base $(INSTALL_LOCATION)/lib/$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).

<h3>Update Win32 PATH</h3>

On WIN32 systems, building shared libraries is the default
setting so, unless SHARED_LIBRARIES was changed to NO, you will
need to update your path to include fullpathname to the NEW
base $(INSTALL_LOCATION)/bin/$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).
