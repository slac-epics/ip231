<h1 style="text-align: center">EPICS Base R3.14.9: Known Problems</h1>

<ul>
  <li>It is not possible to build this version of base on HP-UX due to C++
    issues which appear to be bugs in the HP-UX compiler.</li>

  <li>When shutting down an IOC on a recent version of GNU/Linux (one that
    includes the NPTL threading library) various messages may appear, such as:

    <blockquote>
      <pre>FATAL: exception not rethrown</pre></blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>epicsThread: Unknown C++ exception in thread "CAC-UDP" at ...</pre>
      <pre>terminate called after throwing an instance of ''</pre>
      </blockquote>

    These errors are caused by the implementation of the pthread_cancel()
    mechanism in NPTL, which uses the C++ exception mechanism without providing
    any means to distinguish the cancel exception to regular C++ exception
    handlers. It is possible that they might also occur when a CA client
    application exits (or closes its connection to the CA library).</li>
</ul>
