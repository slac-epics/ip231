<h2>Converting an EPICS R3.14.2 application to R3.14.3</h2></center>

<p>This document describes how to convert a R3.14.2 application
so that it builds and runs properly with release R3.14.3.</p>

<h3>registerRecordDeviceDriver Name Change</h3>

<p>All application iocBoot/iocxxx/st.cmd files must be modified for R3.14.3 as
the generated routine that registers record device and driver support has been
renamed to incorporate the name of the dbd file it came from.  The change to
the startup script is straightforward; any pair of lines like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>dbLoadDatabase("dbd/<i>something</i>.dbd",0,0)
registerRecordDeviceDriver(pdbbase)</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>must have the second line changed so the result looks like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>dbLoadDatabase("dbd/<i>something</i>.dbd",0,0)
<i>something</i>_registerRecordDeviceDriver(pdbbase)</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>There may be other pathname components in the dbLoadDatabase line which
should remain exactly as before.</p>
