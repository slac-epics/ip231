<h1>EPICS Base Release Procedures Checklist</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>ReleaseChecklist.html,v 1.1.2.7 2006/11/30 21:50:14 anj Exp</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This document is a checklist of things that must be done when creating a
new release of EPICS Base. Additions and ammendments to this list are
welcome.</p>

<h3>The Release Process</h3>

<p>The version released on the Feature Freeze date is designated the first
pre-release, <tt>-pre1</tt>. The first Release Candidate <tt>-RC1</tt> is the
first version that has undergone widespread testing and which has no known
problems in it that are slated to be fixed in this release. New versions should
be made at about weekly intervals during the testing and debugging process, and
will be designated as either pre-release versions or Release Candidates by the
Release Manager.  A Release Candidate that has received widespread testing for a
week without any additional problems being discovered or CVS commits being made
can be designated as the final release.</p>

<h3>Roles</h3>

<p>The following roles are used, in addition to the names of individuals who
have been responsible for specific tasks in the past:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Release Manager</strong></dt>
    <dd>Responsible for the release</dd>
  <dt><strong>Platform Developers</strong></dt>
    <dd>Responsible for individual operating system platforms</dd>
</dl>
