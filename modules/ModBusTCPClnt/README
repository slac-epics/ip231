This is a library to support ModBusTCP protocol.
It works as client and talk to device (ModBusTCP server).
So far it supports 10 ModBusTCP functions.
The reason we pick up these 10 functions is because they are the all
functions Beckhoff BK9000/BC9000 supported. And now we use this library
mainly to talk to BK9000.

Look into documentaton, you will see ModBusTCP specification and application
guide. And also you will find manual of BK9000 and BC9000.
Most important, you will see drvModBusTCPClnt.h, that defines all functions
this library gives to you.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Most Important Note!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
We you call MBT_FunctionX, and if it returns -1, basically that could
be two cases: TCP connection closed or TCP connection is OK but get 
exception PDU. You can figure out which case you encountered by check
link status or check error code.

Below are three ways to use it:
1. Once it returns error, no matter which case, call MBT_Disconnect to close link;
2. Once it returns error, no matter which case, use MBT_Function8 to reset server,
   then call MBT_Disconnect. Because if link lost, the reset will do nothing, if link
   still exsit, then must be exception PDU, then you MAYBE want to reset server;
3. Check if link still ok, and how many exception PDUs we already got, then do what
   you want.


Good luck.
