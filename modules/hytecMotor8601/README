This is a driver for the Hytec 8601 4-channel Industry Pack (IP) motor controller card.
It has currently been tested at SLAC with EPICS 3.14.8.2 and uses OSI support in EPICS
with version 5.9 of the Motor Record, but we haven't tested encoder support or home limit
switch options.  It has only been tested under RTEMS.  Also, the concurrent motion
option is not currently implemented.
