calc Module Description (copied from calc webpage):
This module contains support for run-time expression evaluation, similar 
to calcPostfix, in base, but extended to handle strings and additional 
numeric operations. calc also contains the transform record, which 
supports multiple interdependent expressions; gensub-record-based 
array-interpolation support; and the swait record, which is similar to the 
calcout record, but it writes using ca_put_notify(), and thus can detect 
the completion of any processing it causes.
