<h1 align="center">calc Release Notes</h1>

<h2 align="center">Release 2-6-1</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>sCalcout and aCalcout records were not calling device support's
init_record() routine
<li><p>Added FWHM function to array calc support.
</ul>

<h2 align="center">Release 2-6</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Added array calc support.  This generalizes EPICS standard calc support
in much the same way that the string calc support did, but with arrays
instead of strings.

<li><p>Added a python program to test string-calc software.

<li><p>Interp support uses different genSub-record fields, and has acquired a mode switch
and a success indicator.  See calc/documentation/interp.README.

<li><p>sCalcout record has two new functions:
<ul>
<li>TR_ESC() translates escape sequences into the characters they represent
<li>ESC()    translates selected unprintable characters into escape sequences.
</ul>
</ul>

<h2 align="center">Release 2-4</h2>

This version is intended to build with EPICS base 3.14.7.

<ul>
<li><p>interp.c, interp.db, interp.adl - no longer supports spline
interpolation. Array length no longer limited to 2000 elements.  Added range
checking.  Now the number of elements must be specified at load time, with the
macro, N.  Polynomial order is now forced to be in [0..10].
<li><p>All databases have been converted to vdct.
<li><p>Swait-record documentation added
<li><p>New string operators '-|' and '|-' (delete first/last occurrence of
substring).
<li><p>Added arrayTest.c, a gensub-based support for producing unique
arrays at runtime, e.g., for verifying that sscanRecord/saveData are
storing data exactly as it was acquired.  Also added arrayTest.db and
arrayTest.adl.
<li><p>Complete list of stringCalc functions, operators, and
constants, with examples, is available as a set of medm displays,
starting with the top-level display "calcExamples.adl".  All medm
displays that display calc expressions call up these doc displays.
<li><P>stringCalc record now uses device support.  Supplied soft device
support allows the user to specify whether or not to wait for completion
of the operation started by the OUT link.
<li><P>EPICS base no longer contains the code required to check calc
expressions for the sCalcout and transform records at boot time or DCT
time.  (At run time, the expressions are checked by sCalcPostfix.)
<li><P><a href="cvsLog.txt">cvs log</a>
</ul>

<h2 align="center">Release 2-3</h2>

<p align="left">This is the first release of the synApps calc module.
Version numbering for this module begins with 2.3 because this module
was split from version 2.2 of the std module, and I wanted to retain
the CVS histories of module contents.</p>

This version is intended to build with EPICS base 3.14.5.

Differences from software as previously released in std 2.2:
<ul>
<li><p>interp.c, interp.db, interp.adl - now supports spline and
polynomial interpolation.
<li><p>subAve.c - registry stuff
