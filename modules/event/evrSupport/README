This directory contains all the EPICS databases and subroutines
for the EVR iocs that are OSI. This area  builds a library 
that contains lcls beam-synchronous acquisition (bsa) as well as 
all evr support (pattern pipelineing, etc). 
It creates libevrSupport and installs dbd and db files.

evrSupport library (<INSTALL_LOCATION>/lib/<arch>/libevrSupport.a) contents:
src:    functions for subroutine records and evr driver support.
Db/bsa: low-level beam-synchronous-acquisition (BSA) databases.
Db/evr: low-level event receiver (EVR) databases
Db/ioc: EVR IOC substitution files.
