Changes for version V2-3-1

1. General changes.
   o Directory Structure
     - Two application directories, mrfApp and xxxApp.
       mrfApp contains code common to all sites.
       xxxApp can be renamed (slacApp, snsApp, lansceAPP, etc) and contains
       site-specific code.
   o Added SLAC debugPrint utility.
   o Re-worked the CR/CSR handling.
     - Name change from VME64x_cr to mrfVme64x
     - Separated the vmeCSRMemProbe routine from the rest of the
       package and created different versions for different BSPs,
       for if the BSP supports CR/CSR addressing, and for if EPICS
       supports CR/CSR addressing.
     - Added routines to locate and display USER_CSR space.
     - Added "Find Next" routines for EVR card and EVG card.
   o Create MRF_CONFIG_SITE files to configure event clock speed,
     how CR/CSR addressing is done, and possibly other things.
   o Removed the complete copyright from the source codes.  Added an
     abbreviated copyright notice that refers to a central LICENSE file
     for the specifics.

2. Changes to reflect separation of APS and MRF event systems (in R3.14.8.2).
   o Changed devApsEr.* to devMrfEr,*
   o Changed devApsEg.* to devMrfEg.*
   o Changed the "DTYP" names for the eg and egevent records in the
     devMrfEgInclude.dbd file.
   o Changed the "DTYP" names for the er, erevent, and event records in the
     devMrfErInclude.dbd file.
   o Included the code and dbd file for the ereventRecord.

3. Changes to mrfCommon.h
   o Added more common constants
   o Added common "convenience" macros (GLOBAL_RTN, OK, ERROR, NULL, etc.)
   o Added inclusion of SLAC debugPrint.h

4. Changes to drvMrfEr.c
   o Removed specific setting of the FracDiv clock (this can now
     be specified in the MRF_SITE_CONFIG files
   o Removed specific setting of the Control register in ErConfigure.
     Replaced with value that preserves most of the previous contents of
     the control register, but resets lost heartbeats and resets the receive
     violation flag.  Did not add the "clear mapping RAM" as this would cause
     the EVR to stop putting out gates during an IOC soft reboot.
   o Added ErFinishDrvInit routine.  Enables VME IRQ levels after all
     record initialization is finished.


TODO:
o Replace ErLevel with SLAC debugPrint levels.
o Create separate arguments for slot and card number in the VME EG and ER
  configuration routines.
