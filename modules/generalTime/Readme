        # Load general time before the utility module

        cd generaltimebin
        ld <generalTimeLib.munch

        # below is optional  
        cd generaltime
        dbLoadDatabase("dbd/generalTime.dbd")
        generalTime_registerRecordDeviceDriver(pdbbase)
        dbLoadDatabase("db/generalTime.template",0,"IOC=your IOC name")

        # generalTime_Init
