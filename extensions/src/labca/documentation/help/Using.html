Using <B>labCA</B>
</H2>
<B>labCA</B> consists of a set of shared libraries which in turn reference
other shared libraries (most notably the channel access client libraries
from EPICS BASE). It is of <B>crucial importance</B> that the operating
system locates the correct versions at <B>run-time</B> (i.e. the same versions
<B>labCA</B> was <B>linked</B> against). Otherwise, the run-time linker/loader
could fail to load the required objects -- leaving the user (expecially
in <B>matlab</B>) at the prompt with obscure error messages.

<P>
Under <B>linux</B> or <B>solaris</B>, the <TT>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</TT> environment
variable or the <TT>ld.so.conf / ldconfig</TT> facility are used to point
to the executable shared libraries (located in <TT>lib/&lt;arch&gt;</TT>).
If using a binary distribution, the <TT>PATH</TT> variable also should point
to <TT>bin/&lt;arch&gt;</TT> so that the <B>CA repeater</B> executable is found.
If you build from source using your own EPICS base installation then
we assume that locating the <B>CA repeater</B> has already been taken
care of.

<P>
Under <B>win32</B>, the <TT>PATH</TT> environment variable must point to the
correct EPICS BASE and <B>labCA</B> DLLs (located in <TT>bin/&lt;arch&gt;</TT>).

<P>
Note that the paths to the correct EPICS BASE and <B>labCA</B> shared libraries
must be set up <B>prior</B> to starting the <B>scilab</B> or <B>matlab</B> application.
It is usually not possible to change the system search
path from within an application.

<P>
Possible problems could occur because

<UL>
<LI>third party setup scripts modify <TT>LD_LIBRARY_PATH / PATH</TT>.
</LI>
<LI>your EPICS BASE was not built with shared libraries but shared libraries
of a different release are found somewhere.
</LI>
<LI>a ``innocent-looking'' directory present in <TT>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</TT>
before EPICS BASE actually contains shared libraries of an older release.
</LI>
<LI>Note that the system search path is <B>not</B> identical with the
<B>matlab</B> path -- changing the <B>matlab</B> path (from withing <B>matlab</B>)
has no influence on the system search path.
</LI>
</UL>

Using <B>labCA</B> with <B>scilab</B></A>
</H3>
Set up the shared library search path (as described above) and start
<B>scilab</B>. Run the <TT><B>labCA</B>.sce</TT> script which was generated by the build process
(<TT>&lt;<B>labCA</B>-top&gt;/bin/&lt;arch&gt;/<B>labCA</B>.sce</TT>) to load the <B>labCA</B> interface.
The script also adds to the <TT>%helps</TT> variable making on-line
help available.

<P>
The script can be installed at any convenient location -- the lines
setting up the <TT>%helps</TT> path need to be adapted in this case.

<P>
It is also possible to permanently link <B>labCA</B> to <B>scilab</B>. Consult
the <B>scilab</B> documentation for more information.

Every entry point / <TT>lcaXXX</TT> routine 
is contained in a separate
shared object (AKA ``<TT>mex</TT>-'') file in the <TT>&lt;<B>labCA</B>-top&gt;/bin/&lt;arch&gt;/labca</TT><A NAME="tex2html13"
  HREF="#foot816"><SUP>12</SUP></A> directory
which must be added to the <B>matlab</B> search path.
Note that this is in <B>addition</B>
to setting the system library search path which must be performed prior
to starting <B>matlab</B> (see previous section).
All necessary objects and libraries are transparently loaded simply
by invoking any of the entry point routines. Note that on-line help
files are also installed to be located automatically.

the extra subdirectory was added in order for the <B>matlab</B> <TT>help</TT> command
