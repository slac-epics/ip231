ChannelArchiver/Matlab/README
=============================

There is some support for Matlab and Octave,
allowing those two programs to access data
from the ChannelArchiver's Network Data Server.

Compilation
-----------
Building these extensions (MEX resp. OCT files)
can be troublesome because
- Your mex resp. mkoctfile needs to work
- The result needs to be linked with numerous
  other libraries: archiver, xml-rpc

The Makefile might help with the building.
Check if the paths in there match your setup.

Installation
------------
The script "setup.octave" appends the necessary
settings for accessing the binaries and compatibility
scripts to the user's ~/.octaverc file.
Every user who wants to run octave with the archiver
needs to run this script once.

Similarly, there's "setup.matlab" which creates
~/matlab/startup.m.

Usage
-----
See ArchiveData.txt for a description of the various
ways to call the new ArchiveData() routine.
The functionality of ArchiveData might only make sense
after prior consultation of the XML-RPC specification in the 
main ChannelArchiver manual,
ChannelArchiver/manual/manual.pdf.

The ChannelArchiver/Matlab/util subdir. contains some
wrapper scripts for the ArchiveData routine, and then
there are example Matlab scripts in ChannelArchiver/Matlab,
some of which might also work with octave.
