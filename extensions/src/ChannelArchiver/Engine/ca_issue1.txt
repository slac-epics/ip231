Hi Jeff:

I recompiled without optimization,
added a memset(.., 0, ...) to the new() operators that
allocate tcpiiu and ipAddrToAsciiTransactionPrivate on
freelists to better see what gets initialized and what's
left behind from previous uses of that same memory.
I also added simple "debug_marker" members to hostNameCache
and ipAddrToAsciiTransactionPrivate,
setting it to 1 in the constructor, then to 2, 3, ... in various parts of
the code. Example:

hostNameCache::hostNameCache (
    const osiSockAddr & addr, ipAddrToAsciiEngine & engine ) :
    dnsTransaction ( engine.createTransaction() ), nameLength ( 0 )
{
    this->debug_marker = 1;
    this->dnsTransaction.ipAddrToAscii ( addr, *this );
    this->debug_marker = 2;
}


I ran into the same error:
One thread, running ipAddrToAsciiEnginePrivate, is in gethostbyaddr,
another other crashes in the tcpiiu() constructor:

The tcpiiu constructor doesn't get beyond the hostNameCacheInstance initialization,
all the rest is 0.
So it's in the hostNameCache constructor.
Unclear why the debugger claims that's in msgForMultiplyDefinedPV.cpp:43.
So something is clearly wrong.

From the "debug_marker" I can tell that the
dnsTransaction points to a ipAddrToAsciiTransactionPrivate
for which the constructor has finished.
The hostNameCache constructor is about to invoke
   dnsTransaction.ipAddrToAscii()
but never gets there.

It's as if the vtbl for that ipAddrToAsciiTransactionPrivate
is messed up.


Changed the new/delete of ipAddrToAsciiTransactionPrivate to
use malloc/free instead of the free list, and have not seen
another crash since.
