SYNOPSIS
     dbreport [ -tmax_type ]  [  -nmax_name  ]  [  -fdbname  ]  
     [field.sizefield.field.sizefield.size...  ]

AVAILABILITY
     The tool in available under Unix from the EPICS add_on  sys-
     tem.

DESCRIPTION
     Dbreport reads ".db" information from file dbname if the  "-
     f"  option  is  used or from standard in and produces report
     consisting of one line per record.  The information for each
     record contains the record type and name, and the fields the
     user specified on the command  line.   There  is  a  default
     report  which  prints  the  type,  name, description, device
     type, and input/output link fields.  Fields are specified as
     field.size  where field is a valid EPICS database field name
     in a record and size is the maximum width of  the  field  to
     use  in  the  report.   Multiple fields can be placed in the
     same    column    of    the    report    by    using     the
     field1.field2.field3...size  option.   This  indicated  that
     fields 1 through n of maximum size will be put  into  single
     column  in  the  report.   This is useful for fields such as
     INP/OUT.

     -n max_name
          This specifies the maximum  size  of  the  record  name
